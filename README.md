## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Certainly! Below is a detailed step-by-step process for creating a component library, from initial planning to publishing it as an NPM package. This guide will help you structure your workflow and ensure that you cover all necessary aspects of the project.

# Step-by-Step Process to Create a Component Library

## 1. Project Planning
- **Define Goals**: Determine the purpose of the component library and the target audience.
- **Research**: Look into existing libraries (like Shadcn, MagicUI, NextUI) to identify features and components that are commonly used.
- **Component List**: Create a list of components you want to include (e.g., Button, Input, Modal, Navbar, etc.).

## 2. Set Up the Development Environment
- **Initialize the Project**:
  ```bash
  mkdir your-component-library
  cd your-component-library
  npm init -y
  ```
- **Install Development Tools**:
  - Choose a framework (React, Vue, etc.) and install it.
  - Install TypeScript if you want type safety:
    ```bash
    npm install typescript --save-dev
    ```
  - Set up a bundler (like Webpack or Rollup) for building the library.
  - Install testing libraries (like Jest or React Testing Library) for unit tests.

## 3. Create the Project Structure
- Organize your project with a clear folder structure:
  ```
  your-component-library/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   ├── Button/
  │   │   │   ├── Button.tsx
  │   │   │   ├── Button.test.tsx
  │   │   │   └── Button.styles.ts
  │   │   ├── Input/
  │   │   ├── Modal/
  │   │   └── Navbar/
  │   ├── index.ts
  ├── package.json
  ├── tsconfig.json
  └── README.md
  ```

## 4. Develop Components
- **Create Component Files**: For each component, create a `.tsx` file for the component logic, a `.test.tsx` file for tests, and a `.styles.ts` file for styles.
- **Implement Components**: Write the code for each component, ensuring they are reusable and customizable.
- **Document Each Component**: Add comments and usage examples within the component files.

## 5. Styling and Theming
- **Choose a Styling Method**: Decide whether to use CSS Modules, styled-components, or another CSS-in-JS solution.
- **Implement Theming**: Allow users to customize the theme of the components (colors, fonts, etc.).

## 6. Testing
- **Write Unit Tests**: For each component, write tests to ensure they behave as expected.
- **Run Tests**: Use your testing framework to run the tests and ensure everything is functioning correctly.

## 7. Documentation
- **Create Documentation**: Write comprehensive documentation for the library, including:
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples for each component
  - API reference for component props
  - Contribution guidelines
- **Use a Documentation Generator**: Consider using tools like Storybook or Styleguidist to create interactive documentation.

## 8. Prepare for Publishing
- **Update `package.json`**: Ensure that the `name`, `version`, `description`, and `main` fields are correctly set.
- **Add a README**: Include a README file with an overview of the library, installation instructions, and usage examples.
- **Add a License**: Choose a license (e.g., MIT) and include a `LICENSE` file.

## 9. Build the Library
- **Set Up Build Scripts**: Configure your bundler to compile the library into a distributable format (e.g., CommonJS, ES Modules).
- **Run the Build**: Execute the build command to generate the output files.

## 10. Publish to NPM
- **Login to NPM**: If you haven't already, log in to your NPM account:
  ```bash
  npm login
  ```
- **Publish the Package**: Run the following command to publish your library:
  ```bash
  npm publish
  ```

## 11. Maintenance and Updates
- **Monitor Issues**: Keep track of issues and feature requests from users.
- **Regular Updates**: Update the library regularly with new features, bug fixes, and improvements.
- **Changelog**: Maintain a changelog to document changes in each version.

## 12. Community Engagement
- **Encourage Contributions**: Create a welcoming environment for contributors by providing clear guidelines.
- **Promote the Library**: Share your library on social media, forums, and developer communities to gain visibility.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can systematically create a component library that is well-structured, tested, documented, and ready for public use. Each step is crucial for ensuring the quality and usability of your library, so take the time to execute them thoroughly.

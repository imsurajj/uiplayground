# Contributing to Our Component Library

We love your input! We want to make contributing to our component library as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Development Process
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](../../issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

4. Make your changes and commit them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add your commit message"
```

5. Push to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

6. Open a Pull Request

## Component Guidelines

When creating new components:

1. Follow the existing component structure
2. Include TypeScript types
3. Add proper documentation
4. Include unit tests
5. Ensure accessibility standards are met
6. Follow the project's coding style
